# ReactJS uses several types of state
•	[Local/Isolated] - [Component] - (useState, useReducer) - [Forms, toggles, modal visibility]
•	[Global] - [App-wide] - (Context API, Redux, Zustand, Recoil) - [Authentication, theme, user data]
•	[Derived/Computed] - [Varies] - (useMemo, selectors) - [Filtering, sorting, transformation of data]
•	[Server/Async] - [App-wide] - (React Query, SWR, fetch, axios) - [Remote data fetching, API integration]
•	[App (UI)] - [Varies] - (Mixed: local/global) - [Sidebar visibility, notifications, layout state]
•	[URL/Navigation] - [Route/Global] - (React Router, Next.js router) - [Pagination, query filters, current page]
